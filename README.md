Fez is a PHP / MySQL front end to the Fedora repository software. It is developed by the University of Queensland Library
as an open source project.

We will add more to github markdown wiki documentation soon, please see
[https://github.com/uqlibrary/fez/wiki](https://github.com/uqlibrary/fez/wiki "Wiki") for updates.

# Development quick start

Add the following to your hosts file:

    127.0.0.1    dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au fezdb

If you are using docker-machine, replace the 127.0.0.1 with the result of `docker-machine ip fez-vm`

Start the docker container using docker-compose:

    $ cd /path/to/repo/.docker/development
    $ docker-compose up -d

Once the containers are running proceed with the setup steps below.

## Setup

Install fez:

    $ cd /path/to/repo
    $ ./scripts/dev.sh

This will create a config.inc.php for you and setup some basic configs.

Once the script has completed you can now login:

[http://dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au:8080/login.php](http://dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au:8080/login.php)

    u: superadmin_test
    p: Ilovedonkey5

Run the sanity checks:

[http://dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au:8080/upgrade/check_sanity.php](http://dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au:8080/upgrade/check_sanity.php)

Celebrate your new Fez dev site!

## Testing

To run the tests:

    $ cd /path/to/repo
    $ ./scripts/run-tests.sh
    
To visually see the functional tests running in a browser, VNC into dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au:5900 with
the password `secret`.

You can also run the tests using Codeship Jet:

    $ cd /path/to/repo
    $ jet steps
    
## Useful Links

### Fedora Tomcat Admin

[http://dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au:10081/manager/html](http://dev-fez.library.uq.edu.au:10081/manager/html)

u: fedoraAdmin
p: fedoraAdmin

NB: Sometimes fedora (inside tomcat, inside the fedora container) doesnt start on boot because maybe the fedora sql
container wasn't ready in time. If this happens just go to the above link and login and click start on the fedora tomcat
application.

### Solr Dashboard

## Bypass Setup (Experimental!)

To run Fez with Bypass enabled, export the following environment variables:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="REPLACEME"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="REPLACEME"
    FEZ_S3_BUCKET="REPLACEME"
    FEZ_S3_SRC_PREFIX="REPLACEME"
    AWS_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PAIR_ID="REPLACEME"
    AWS_CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE="REPLACEME"
    AWS_CLOUDFRONT_FILE_SERVE_URL="REPLACEME"

Where AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY have access to the bucket FEZ_S3_BUCKET. For shared buckets, e.g. 
in development, add you username to FEZ_S3_SRC_PREFIX.

The FEZ_S3_BUCKET should be created manually in S3 before running the dev.sh script. Folders required in this bucket 
will be generated by the script automatically, and cleared if they already exist.

CloudFront settings are not just for production but can be used to test file delivery in a development environment and some features require it
like the pdf bookreader functionality. The CloudFront private key is a full path to the file as it exists in the container. The file serve url is the full distribution url including protocol
eg "https://fez.org". The key pair ID is found in your AWS Cloudfront security configuration settings.
