<h4>Account Preferences</h4>
<span class="default">
This screen allows users to change their appropriate full name, account
password and email address. This address will be used by the system to
send email notifications whenever details about issues you are 
subscribed to changes.
<br /><br />
You may also set the appropriate timezone where you live in this 
screen, and all of the software will adjust the dates displayed in
the system accordingly.
<br /><br />
The default options for email notifications are used to pre-select
the notification related fields when you report a new issue, or 
subscribe manually for changes in the issue details page.
