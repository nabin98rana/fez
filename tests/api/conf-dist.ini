; INSTRUCTIONS:
;
; Records in this set should inherit or set security that requires
; a FEZ GROUP for authentication.
;
; For the collection(s) in this group, edit security with the following:
; - Viewer / Fez Group   = viewer_group
; - Editor / Fez Group   = editor_group
; - Approver / Fez Group = approver_group
;
; DO NOT TICK 'Restrict to Fez Authenticated Users?' for any of these.
; (if you do, any successful authentication will be authorized)
;
; Records should then be set to inherit their settings.
